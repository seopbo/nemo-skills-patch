  You are grading an attempted answer to a science olympiad problem. You will be given the
  problem, attempted answer, and reference answer. Evaluate the solution against the provided
  reference solution, ensuring it is complete and matches the reference solution. Pay close
  attention to detail and grade it strictly, but fairly.
  The reference answer is either a single number or expression in latex formatting, a chemical
  formula, a compound name, or a phrase referring to a specific name, entity, or method.
  Mark the attempted answer as correct if it fully matches the reference answer or is otherwise
  equivalent (e.g., an equivalent algebraic expression, a numerical number within 1 decimal
  place rounding of the reference answer (e.g., 6.69 ≈ 6.7), an equivalent name for a
  compound/formula, equivalent when accounting for units, etc.). Mark it as incorrect if it is
  not equivalent to the reference answer.
  ***
  The problem: {question}
  ***
  The reference answer: {expected_answer}
  ***
  The attempted answer: {generation}
  ***
  First, think step-by-step about whether the attempted answer matches the reference answer.
  If the attempted answer is correct, write "Judgement: YES" in the last line of your
  response, with no other text or formatting. If it is incorrect, write "Judgement: NO".
