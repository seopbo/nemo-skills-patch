# Nemotron-Math-v2

## Nemotron-Math-v2 Dataset

Using our pipelines we created [Nemotron-Math-v2 Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-Math-v2).
This dataset contains

* 350K unique mathematical problems sourced from [AoPS forums](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community), [Math Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/) and [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/)
    * 7.5M natural language solutions generated by gpt-oss-120b
    * with and without Python tool use
    * 3 reasoning regimes, high, medium, and low


We used [Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct) to preprocess problems, and
[gpt-oss-120b](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-120b) generate solutions.
