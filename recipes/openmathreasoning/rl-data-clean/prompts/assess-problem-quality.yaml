  You are a mathematics education expert and IMO competition judge. Your task is to evaluate the quality of a math problem statement.

  Problem:
  {problem}

  Evaluate the problem across these dimensions:

  ## 1. CLARITY (1-5)
  How clear and unambiguous is the problem statement?
  - 5: Exceptionally clear, every term well-defined, no ambiguity
  - 4: Clear and well-defined, minor improvements possible
  - 3: Acceptable clarity, some terms could be clearer
  - 2: Somewhat unclear, requires guessing or assumptions
  - 1: Very unclear, missing critical information or confusing

  ## 2. COMPLETENESS (1-5)
  Does the problem contain all necessary information?
  - 5: Fully self-contained, includes all needed definitions and conditions
  - 4: Nearly complete, minimal context needed
  - 3: Mostly complete, some standard assumptions required
  - 2: Missing some important information
  - 1: Missing critical information, cannot solve without more context

  ## 3. MATHEMATICAL_RIGOR (1-5)
  Is the mathematical notation and terminology correct and rigorous?
  - 5: Perfect notation, follows standard conventions exactly
  - 4: Rigorous notation, very minor issues if any
  - 3: Generally correct notation, some informality acceptable
  - 2: Some notation errors or non-standard usage
  - 1: Significant notation problems or incorrect terminology

  ## 4. DIFFICULTY_ESTIMATE
  Estimate the IMO difficulty level of this problem:
  - P1: Easiest IMO problem (accessible, straightforward)
  - P2: Easy-medium (requires standard techniques)
  - P3: Medium (requires insight and technique)
  - P4: Medium-hard (challenging, multiple steps)
  - P5: Hard (very challenging, requires deep insight)
  - P6: Hardest (extremely challenging, novel approach needed)
  - NON_IMO: Not appropriate for IMO (too easy, too computational, or not proof-based)

  Provide your assessment in the following EXACT format:

  CLARITY_SCORE: <1-5>
  CLARITY_REASONING: <Explain what makes it clear or unclear. Be specific about any issues.>

  COMPLETENESS_SCORE: <1-5>
  COMPLETENESS_REASONING: <Are all conditions stated? Is context needed? Be specific.>

  MATHEMATICAL_RIGOR_SCORE: <1-5>
  MATHEMATICAL_RIGOR_REASONING: <Evaluate notation, terminology. Point out any issues.>

  DIFFICULTY_ESTIMATE: <P1/P2/P3/P4/P5/P6/NON_IMO>
  DIFFICULTY_REASONING: <Why this difficulty? What techniques are needed?>

  OVERALL_PROBLEM_QUALITY: <excellent/good/acceptable/poor>
  OVERALL_REASONING: <Brief summary of the problem's quality>

  RECOMMENDATION: <accept/review/reject>

  Output:
