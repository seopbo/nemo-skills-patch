  You are an IMO jury member with decades of experience evaluating mathematical proofs. Assess this proof with the highest standards of mathematical rigor.

  Problem:
  {problem}

  Proposed Proof:
  {proof}

  Evaluate the proof across these critical dimensions:

  ## 1. CORRECTNESS
  Is the proof mathematically correct?
  - correct: Proof is logically sound, no mathematical errors, conclusion follows from premises
  - incorrect: Proof contains logical errors, false claims, or invalid reasoning
  - uncertain: Cannot determine (proof too incomplete, unclear, or uses unproven claims)

  If incorrect or uncertain, explain the specific issues.

  ## 2. RIGOR (1-5)
  How rigorous is the proof by IMO standards?

  **Evaluation criteria:**
  - Are all claims justified?
  - Are there logical gaps or unjustified leaps?
  - Is every step clearly explained?
  - Are all necessary lemmas stated and proven (or cited)?

  **Rating scale:**
  - 5 = Competition-ready: Every step proven, no gaps, would receive full marks at IMO
  - 4 = Rigorous: Well-justified, very minor gaps that are trivial to fill
  - 3 = Mostly complete: Main ideas clear, some steps could use more justification
  - 2 = Sketch: Outline is correct but missing significant details
  - 1 = Handwavy: Major gaps, many unjustified claims, "it's obvious that..."

  ## 3. ELEGANCE (1-5)
  How elegant and insightful is the solution?

  **Evaluation criteria:**
  - Does it reveal the problem's essence or use brute force?
  - Is the approach clever and insightful or computational?
  - Is the proof concise or unnecessarily long?

  **Rating scale:**
  - 5 = Elegant: Beautiful key insight, reveals problem structure, makes it look easy
  - 4 = Insightful: Contains clever observations, efficient approach
  - 3 = Standard: Uses well-known techniques, direct and effective
  - 2 = Computational: Relies mainly on calculation or case analysis
  - 1 = Brute force: Pure computation, enumeration, no mathematical insight

  ## 4. COMPLETENESS
  What percentage of the proof is present?
  - complete (100%): Full proof from start to finish
  - nearly_complete (80-99%): Missing only minor details
  - partial (50-79%): Major steps present but significant gaps
  - sketch (20-49%): Only outline or key ideas
  - minimal (<20%): Almost nothing, just hints

  ## 5. MULTIPLE_APPROACHES
  Are multiple solution methods discussed or presented?
  - yes: Multiple distinct approaches shown
  - no: Single approach only
