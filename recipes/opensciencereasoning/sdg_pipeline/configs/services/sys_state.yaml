    Internet access is available. If a website cannot be retrieved (e.g., due to
    403 or 404 errors), it most likely means the site is unavailable or does not
    exist. Do NOT assume that the internet is globally unavailable after such
    failures — you may continue to use available online sources.

    Google Search and Researchgate.net are unavailable in this environment.
    DO NOT USE GOOGLE SEARCH OR RESEARCHGATE.NET OR BRAVE SEARCH (https://search.brave.com) OR ANY OTHER SEARCH ENGINE.
    Banned search engines: google, researchgate.net, brave.
