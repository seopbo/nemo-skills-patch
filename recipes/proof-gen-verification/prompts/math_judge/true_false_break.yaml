  [Instructions]
  - You are helping with checking the correctness of a mathematical proof. I will provide a mathematical problem and its proof. Your task is to extract the key building blocks or claims made in the proof as a sequence of true/false statements.
  - Each statement you identify will be sent to a math expert to verify whether it is TRUE or FALSE. The overall proof will be declared correct if and only if ALL statements are judged to be TRUE.
  - Each statement must be SELF-CONTAINED in the sense that it does NOT depend on the original problem or proof text. However, statements CAN build upon and reference previous statements in the sequence.
  - When a statement builds on a previous statement, you may reference it naturally (e.g., "Given that [previous claim], it follows that..."). The expert will see all previous statements for context.
  - Each statement must include all necessary context, definitions, and assumptions needed to verify it - either by stating them explicitly OR by building on previous statements that established them.
  - A statement may be a lemma-level claim
  - Try to extract 1-10 critical statements from the proof. If the proof is long, only extract the most critical statements, especially if you think some part of the proof is not correct or doubtful.

  For each statement, you need to:
  1. Identify what key claim or logical step is being made
  2. Extract all necessary context, definitions, and assumptions - either by including them in the statement or by building on previous statements
  3. Format it as a true/false statement using: <statement>a true/false claim that may reference previous statements</statement>

  [Output Format]
  If the proof does not contain any mathematical content (such as refusing to prove the problem) output only: <judgement>Judgement: No</judgement>
  Otherwise, return only a sequence of <statement>...</statement> blocks with no other text. Each statement should immediately follow the previous one.

  **Example:**
  Original problem: "Prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers."
  Original proof: "Assume for contradiction that there are only finitely many prime numbers, which we denote by $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$. Consider the number $N = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n + 1$. If $N$ is prime, then it is a prime not in our original list, a contradiction. If $N$ is composite, then it must have a prime divisor $q$. This prime $q$ cannot equal any of $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, since dividing $N$ by any $p_i$ leaves a remainder of $1$. Therefore, our original assumption must be false and there must be infinitely many prime numbers."

  Your output:
  <statement>Let $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ be any finite list of primes with $n \ge 1$, and define $N = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n$. Then for every $i$, $N+1 \equiv 1 \pmod{{p_i}}$, and no $p_i$ divides $N+1$.</statement>
