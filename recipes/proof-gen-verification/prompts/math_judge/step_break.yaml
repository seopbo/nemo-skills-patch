  [Instructions]
  I will provide a mathematical problem and its proof. Your task is to break down the proof into logical steps by inserting <step> tags between each step. Each step should represent one logical deduction or reasoning unit.

  **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
  1. You must preserve the EXACT original text of the proof
  2. Only insert <step> tags between logical steps - do not add, remove, or modify any other text
  3. If I remove all <step> tags from your output, it must exactly match the original proof
  4. Each step should be one logical deduction, calculation, or reasoning unit
  5. Do not add explanations, comments, or any other text
  6. Do no think, this is an easy task.

  **Format:**
  Return only the proof with <step> tags inserted at appropriate positions. Do not include any other text in your response.

  **Example:**
  Original proof: "Let x = 2. Then x^2 = 4. Since 4 > 3, we have x^2 > 3. Answer: x^2 > 3."
  Your output: "Let x = 2.<step> Then x^2 = 4.<step> Since 4 > 3, we have x^2 > 3.<step> Answer: x^2 > 3."
