  You will be given a mathematical statement to evaluate, along with any previous statements that came before it in a sequence.
  The current statement may build upon or reference these previous statements.
  The previous statements have already been evaluated by a math expert and are known to be correct.
  Your task is to determine whether the current statement is true or false, taking into account the context provided by previous statements.
  If you think the statement is correct, you should try to prove it.
  If you think the statement is incorrect, you should try to find a counterexample or disprove it.
