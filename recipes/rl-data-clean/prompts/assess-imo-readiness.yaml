  You are an IMO preparation expert and coach. Make the final decision: Is this problem-proof pair suitable for training an AI model to solve IMO-level competition problems?

  Problem:
  {problem}

  Proof:
  {proof}

  Previous Quality Assessments:
  - Problem Quality: {problem_quality_summary}
  - Discussion Quality: {discussion_quality_summary}
  - Proof Quality: {proof_quality_summary}

  Make the final decision based on these critical factors:

  ## 1. OLYMPIAD_STYLE
  Is this a typical olympiad-style problem?
  - Analyze: Does it require proof, creativity, and insight (not just computation)?
  - Check: Is it self-contained? Does it have an "aha!" moment?
  - Reject if: Pure computation, routine textbook exercise, or requires graduate-level theory

  ## 2. PEDAGOGICAL_VALUE
  Would solving this problem help prepare someone for IMO?
  - Analyze: Does it teach important techniques or problem-solving skills?
  - Consider: Can students learn and apply this technique to other problems?
  - Reject if: Too specific, no generalizable technique, or bad example

  ## 3. DIFFICULTY_APPROPRIATENESS
  Is the difficulty appropriate for IMO training?
  - Accept if: IMO P1-P6 range (from accessible to very challenging)
  - Reject if: Trivial (below IMO level) or too hard (research-level, requires advanced theory)

  ## 4. PROOF_TEACHABILITY
  Can the proof technique be learned and generalized?
  - Analyze: Is the technique generalizable to similar problems?
  - Reject if: One-off trick, relies on guessing, or method is not reproducible

  ## 5. TRAINING_SIGNAL_QUALITY
  Is this suitable for RL training?
  - Analyze: Is the problem-solution pair clear enough to provide good training signal?
  - Check: Can a model learn from this example?
  - Reject if: Ambiguous problem, incorrect/unclear proof, or reward signal is unclear

  ## 6. OVERALL_QUALITY
  Synthesize all previous assessments:
  - Problem quality (clarity, completeness, rigor)
  - Discussion quality (if applicable)
  - Proof quality (correctness, rigor, clarity)
  - All above factors (olympiad style, pedagogy, difficulty, teachability, RL suitability)

  ## Decision Criteria for ACCEPT:
  - Must be olympiad-style (requires proof and insight)
  - Must have pedagogical value (teaches generalizable techniques)
  - Must be appropriate difficulty (IMO P1-P6 range)
  - Must be teachable (technique can be learned and applied)
  - Must be suitable for RL training (clear problem-solution pair)
  - Previous quality assessments must show no critical issues

  ## Decision Criteria for REJECT:
  - Not olympiad-style (computational, routine, or research-level)
  - Low pedagogical value (too specific, no learning value)
  - Inappropriate difficulty (trivial or requires advanced theory)
  - Not teachable (one-off trick, not generalizable)
  - Poor training signal (ambiguous, incorrect, or unclear)
  - Previous quality assessments show critical issues

  Provide your assessment in EXACT format:

  OLYMPIAD_STYLE_ANALYSIS:
  <Is this a typical olympiad problem? Does it require proof, creativity, insight? Or is it computational/routine/research-level?>

  PEDAGOGICAL_VALUE_ANALYSIS:
  <What can be learned from this problem? What techniques does it teach? Are they generalizable?>

  DIFFICULTY_APPROPRIATENESS_ANALYSIS:
  <What IMO difficulty level (P1-P6)? Is it appropriate for training or too easy/hard?>

  PROOF_TEACHABILITY_ANALYSIS:
  <Can this technique be learned and applied to other problems? Or is it too specific?>

  TRAINING_SIGNAL_QUALITY_ANALYSIS:
  <Is the problem-solution pair clear enough for RL training? Can a model learn from this?>

  OVERALL_QUALITY_SYNTHESIS:
  <Synthesize all previous quality assessments. What are the key strengths and critical issues?>

  CRITICAL_ISSUES:
  <List any deal-breakers: not olympiad-style, low pedagogical value, wrong difficulty, not teachable, poor training signal, or issues from previous assessments. If none, state "None">

  DECISION: <ACCEPT/REJECT>
  DECISION_REASONING: <Final decision with clear justification. Why is this suitable or not suitable for IMO training data? Reference specific factors.>
