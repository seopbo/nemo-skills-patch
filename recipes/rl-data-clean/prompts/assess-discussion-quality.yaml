  You are evaluating a mathematical forum discussion. Your goal is to determine if the discussion contains useful, clear solution content suitable for training an AI model.

  Problem:
  {problem}

  Forum Discussion:
  {forum_discussions}

  Analyze the discussion:

  ## 1. MEANINGFUL_CONTENT
  Does the discussion contain substantive mathematical content?
  - Analyze: Are there serious solution attempts, mathematical reasoning, or helpful hints?
  - Reject if: Only questions like "help me", "I don't know", or off-topic chat
  - Reject if: No mathematical substance, just social interactions

  ## 2. SOLUTION_PRESENCE
  Is there at least one usable solution?
  - Analyze: Does at least one post contain a complete or near-complete solution?
  - The approach should be clear even if some details are missing
  - Partial sketches or incomplete attempts are not sufficient

  ## 3. SOLUTION_CLARITY
  If a solution is present, is it clear and followable?
  - Analyze: Can you follow the logic step by step?
  - Check: Is mathematical reasoning explained or just stated?
  - Reject if: Solution is cryptic, unexplained, or uses unclear notation

  ## 4. DISCUSSION_COHERENCE
  Is the discussion organized and coherent?
  - Analyze: Does it flow logically? Do posts build on each other?
  - Minor disorganization is acceptable if the solution is clear
  - Reject if: Completely incoherent or impossible to follow

  ## 5. MULTIPLE_APPROACHES (Bonus)
  Are multiple solution approaches discussed?
  - This is a bonus but not required for ACCEPT
  - Multiple clear approaches add pedagogical value

  ## Decision Criteria for ACCEPT:
  - Discussion contains meaningful mathematical content
  - At least one clear, usable solution is present
  - Solution can be followed and understood
  - Discussion is coherent enough to extract the solution

  Provide your assessment in EXACT format:

  MEANINGFUL_CONTENT_ANALYSIS:
  <Does the discussion contain substantive math? Or just "help me" posts? Be specific.>

  SOLUTION_PRESENCE_ANALYSIS:
  <Is there a complete/near-complete solution? Describe what's provided. If no solution, explain what's missing.>

  SOLUTION_CLARITY_ANALYSIS:
  <If solution exists: Is it clear and followable? Can you understand the logic? Any unclear parts? If no solution, state "N/A">

  DISCUSSION_COHERENCE_ANALYSIS:
  <Is the discussion organized? Does it flow logically? Any major coherence issues?>

  MULTIPLE_APPROACHES: <yes/no>
  APPROACHES_DESCRIPTION: <If yes, list the approaches. If no, state "Single approach" or "No approaches">

  CRITICAL_ISSUES:
  <List any serious problems: no solution, unclear reasoning, incoherent discussion, etc. If none, state "None">

  DECISION: <ACCEPT/REJECT>
  DECISION_REASONING: <Why accept or reject? Be specific about what makes it usable or not.>

  Output:
