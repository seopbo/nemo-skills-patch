  You are evaluating the quality of a mathematical forum discussion. Your goal is to determine if the discussion contains useful solution content for training an AI model.

  Problem:
  {problem}

  Forum Discussion:
  {forum_discussions}

  Evaluate the discussion quality:

  ## 1. MEANINGFUL_DISCUSSION
  Does the discussion contain substantive mathematical content?
  - yes: Discussion includes serious solution attempts, mathematical reasoning, or helpful hints
  - no: Discussion is only questions like "help me", "I don't know", or off-topic chat

  ## 2. SOLUTION_PRESENT
  Is there at least one complete or near-complete solution in the discussion?
  - yes: At least one post contains a solution (may have minor gaps but the approach is clear)
  - no: No solutions, only questions or incomplete sketches

  ## 3. SOLUTION_CLARITY (1-5)
  If a solution is present, how clear is it?
  - 5: Crystal clear, easy to follow every step
  - 4: Clear, understandable with minor effort
  - 3: Somewhat clear, requires careful reading
  - 2: Unclear in places, hard to follow
  - 1: Very unclear or incomprehensible
  - N/A: No solution present

  ## 4. DISCUSSION_COHERENCE (1-5)
  How coherent and organized is the discussion?
  - 5: Well-organized, logical flow, builds on previous posts
  - 4: Mostly coherent, follows a thread
  - 3: Somewhat scattered but followable
  - 2: Disorganized, jumps around
  - 1: Incoherent, random posts

  ## 5. MULTIPLE_APPROACHES
  Are multiple solution approaches discussed?
  - yes: Multiple different methods are presented
  - no: Only one approach (or no complete approaches)

  Provide your assessment in EXACT format:

  MEANINGFUL_DISCUSSION: <yes/no>
  MEANINGFUL_DISCUSSION_EXPLANATION: <Why is it meaningful or not?>

  SOLUTION_PRESENT: <yes/no>
  SOLUTION_DESCRIPTION: <If yes, briefly describe what solution(s) are provided. If no, explain what's missing.>

  SOLUTION_CLARITY: <1-5/N/A>
  SOLUTION_CLARITY_REASONING: <Why this rating?>

  DISCUSSION_COHERENCE: <1-5>
  COHERENCE_REASONING: <How organized is the discussion?>

  MULTIPLE_APPROACHES: <yes/no>
  APPROACHES_DESCRIPTION: <If yes, list the different approaches. If no, state "Single approach" or "No approaches">

  OVERALL_DISCUSSION_QUALITY: <excellent/good/acceptable/poor>
  OVERALL_REASONING: <Brief summary>

  RECOMMENDATION: <accept/review/reject>

  Output:
