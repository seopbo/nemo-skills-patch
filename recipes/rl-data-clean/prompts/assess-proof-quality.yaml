  You are an IMO jury member with decades of experience. Determine if this proof meets IMO training data quality standards.

  Problem:
  {problem}

  Proposed Proof:
  {extracted_proof}

  Analyze the proof rigorously:

  ## 1. CORRECTNESS
  Is the proof mathematically correct?
  - Verify: Are all logical steps valid? Does the conclusion follow?
  - Check: Are there mathematical errors or false claims?
  - If uncertain, specify what cannot be verified

  ## 2. RIGOR & COMPLETENESS
  Is the proof rigorous and complete by IMO competition standards?
  - Analyze: Are all claims justified or are there unjustified leaps?
  - Check: Is every step explained clearly?
  - Evaluate: Would this proof receive full marks at IMO?
  - Identify: What's missing? What gaps exist?

  ## 3. CLARITY
  Is the proof clear and followable?
  - Analyze: Can you follow the logic step by step?
  - Check: Is notation standard and explained?
  - Reject if: Cryptic, uses undefined notation, or logic is unclear

  ## 4. MATHEMATICAL INSIGHT
  Does the proof demonstrate mathematical insight?
  - Analyze: Does it reveal the problem's structure or use brute force?
  - Consider: Is the approach clever and efficient, or purely computational?
  - Note: Elegant proofs are preferred but not required for ACCEPT

  ## Decision Criteria for ACCEPT:
  - Proof is mathematically correct (or any errors are trivial)
  - Proof is sufficiently rigorous and complete (at least 80% complete, minor gaps acceptable)
  - Proof is clear and followable
  - Proof demonstrates mathematical reasoning (not just computation)

  ## Decision Criteria for REJECT:
  - Proof contains significant mathematical errors
  - Proof has major logical gaps (< 80% complete)
  - Proof is unclear or impossible to follow
  - Proof is purely computational with no mathematical insight

  Provide your assessment in EXACT format:

  CORRECTNESS_ANALYSIS:
  <Is the proof mathematically correct? If incorrect, specify the error. If uncertain, explain why.>

  RIGOR_AND_COMPLETENESS_ANALYSIS:
  <Detailed analysis: Are steps justified? What gaps exist? Is it IMO competition-ready? Be specific about what's well-justified and what's missing.>

  CLARITY_ANALYSIS:
  <Is the proof clear and followable? Can you understand each step? Any notation issues?>

  MATHEMATICAL_INSIGHT_ANALYSIS:
  <Does the proof show insight or is it brute force? What's the key idea? Is it elegant or computational?>

  CRITICAL_ISSUES:
  <List any serious problems: mathematical errors, major gaps, unclear logic, etc. If none, state "None">

  DECISION: <ACCEPT/REJECT>
  DECISION_REASONING: <Why accept or reject? Reference specific strengths or critical issues. Be clear about what makes it usable or not.>
