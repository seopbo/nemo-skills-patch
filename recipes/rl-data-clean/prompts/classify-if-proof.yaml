  You are a mathematics expert. Your task is to determine if a math problem is a PROOF problem.

  A proof problem requires proving a mathematical statement, not just computing an answer.

  Problem:
  {problem}

  ## Characteristics of PROOF problems:
  - Uses phrases like "prove that", "show that", "demonstrate that"
  - Asks to justify or explain why a statement is true
  - No specific numerical answer expected
  - Requires logical argumentation

  ## NOT proof problems:
  - "Compute...", "Calculate...", "Find..." (computational)
  - Multiple choice questions
  - "How many..." (counting/enumeration)
  - "What is the value of..." (numerical answer)

  ## Examples:

  **Example 1: PROOF**
  Problem: "Prove that √2 is irrational"
  → This is clearly a proof problem

  **Example 2: PROOF**
  Problem: "Show that for all integers n, n³ - n is divisible by 6"
  → Requires proof

  **Example 3: NOT PROOF**
  Problem: "Find all integer solutions to x² + y² = 25"
  → Asks to find/compute, not prove

  **Example 4: NOT PROOF**
  Problem: "How many ways can you arrange 5 books on a shelf?"
  → Counting problem, computational

  **Example 5: BORDERLINE → Consider PROOF**
  Problem: "Determine all triangles with integer sides and perimeter 12"
  → Uses "determine" but if solution requires proving no other solutions exist, treat as PROOF

  Respond in EXACT format:

  CLASSIFICATION: <proof/not_proof>
  REASONING: <Explain why this is or isn't a proof problem. What words/structure indicate this?>
  CONFIDENCE: <high/medium/low>

  Output:
