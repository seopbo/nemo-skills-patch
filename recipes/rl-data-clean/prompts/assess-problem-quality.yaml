  You are a mathematics education expert and IMO competition judge. Your task is to evaluate if a math problem statement meets the quality standards for IMO training data.

  Problem:
  {problem}

  Analyze the problem across these critical dimensions:

  ## 1. CLARITY
  Is the problem statement clear and unambiguous?
  - Analyze: Are all terms well-defined? Can the problem be understood without guessing?
  - Identify any unclear or ambiguous parts
  - Check if mathematical notation is standard and correct

  ## 2. COMPLETENESS
  Does the problem contain all necessary information?
  - Analyze: Is the problem self-contained?
  - Check if all conditions and constraints are explicitly stated
  - Identify any missing information that would prevent solving

  ## 3. MATHEMATICAL_RIGOR
  Is the mathematical formulation rigorous and correct?
  - Analyze: Is notation correct and follows conventions?
  - Check for mathematical errors or imprecision
  - Verify terminology is used correctly

  ## 4. DIFFICULTY_ESTIMATE
  What is the approximate IMO difficulty level?
  - P1/P2: Accessible, uses standard techniques
  - P3/P4: Requires insight and multiple steps
  - P5/P6: Very challenging, requires deep creativity
  - NON_IMO: Too easy, too computational, or not proof-based

  ## Decision Criteria for ACCEPT:
  - Problem is clear enough to understand without ambiguity
  - All necessary information is present (or can be reasonably assumed from standard conventions)
  - Mathematical notation is correct and rigorous
  - Difficulty is appropriate for IMO training (P1-P6 range)

  Provide your assessment in the following EXACT format:

  CLARITY_ANALYSIS:
  <Detailed analysis: Is the problem statement clear? Are terms well-defined? Any ambiguities? Be specific.>

  COMPLETENESS_ANALYSIS:
  <Detailed analysis: Is all necessary information present? What's missing, if anything? Be specific.>

  MATHEMATICAL_RIGOR_ANALYSIS:
  <Detailed analysis: Is notation correct? Any terminology issues? Be specific.>

  DIFFICULTY_ESTIMATE: <P1/P2/P3/P4/P5/P6/NON_IMO>
  DIFFICULTY_REASONING: <Why this difficulty level? What techniques/insights are needed?>

  CRITICAL_ISSUES:
  <List any serious problems that would prevent using this for training. If none, state "None">

  DECISION: <ACCEPT/REJECT>
  DECISION_REASONING: <Why accept or reject? Reference the specific issues or strengths.>

  Output:
