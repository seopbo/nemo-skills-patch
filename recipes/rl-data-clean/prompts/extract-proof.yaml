  I will give you a math proof problem and a series of forum posts discussing its solution.
  Your task is to extract the most complete and clear proof/solution from the discussion.

  Guidelines:
  - Extract the mathematical proof or solution, focusing on logical steps and reasoning
  - Remove social comments like "Thanks!", "Nice solution", "I agree", etc.
  - Remove personal commentary, questions, or off-topic discussions
  - If multiple solutions are presented, choose the most complete and rigorous one
  - If no valid proof is found, output "Proof not found."
  - Keep all mathematical notation, formulas, and explanations
  - Organize the proof in a clear, logical flow

  Here are some examples.

  Example 1

  Problem:
  Prove that for real numbers \(x\) and \(y\) satisfying \(0 < x, y \le 1\), the inequality \(\sqrt{{3}} \le 2(x+y) - \sqrt{{4xy-1}} \le \frac{{5}}{{2}}\) holds.

  Forum discussions:
  Post 1 by user123steeve: For the LHS, \[2(x+y)-\sqrt{{4xy-1}} \ge 2(x+y)-\sqrt{{(x+y)^2-1}}\]  Put $x+y=\sec\theta$, then we need \[2\sec\theta-\tan\theta\ge \sqrt{{3}} \iff \sqrt{{3}}\cos\theta+\sin\theta=2\cos[\theta-\frac{{\pi}}{{6}}] \ge 2\] which is true for all $\theta$ with equality when $\theta = \frac{{\pi}}{{6}}$ and $x=y$ i.e. at $x=y=\frac{{1}}{{\sqrt{{3}}}}$

  For the RHS, from the condition, $y \le 1$ and from the square root, $y \ge \frac{{1}}{{4x}} \ge \frac{{1}}{{4}}$. This gives \[(4y-1)(1-y) \ge 0 \iff 1+4y^2 \le 5y\] Also \[(2y-1)^2 \ge 0 \Rightarrow 4y^2+1 \ge 4y \ge 4xy \Rightarrow \sqrt{{4xy-1}} \le 2y\] Rearrange as \[\sqrt{{4xy-1}}\left(\frac{{\sqrt{{4xy-1}}}}{{2y}}-1\right)+\frac{{1+4y^2}}{{2y}} \le \frac{{5}}{{2}}\] with equality when $x=1, y=\frac{{1}}{{4}}$

  Post 2 by MariusStanean: Thanks! Very nice solution.

  Output:
  **Proof of the left inequality:**

  For the LHS, we have:
  \[2(x+y)-\sqrt{{4xy-1}} \ge 2(x+y)-\sqrt{{(x+y)^2-1}}\]

  Let $x+y=\sec\theta$. Then we need to show:
  \[2\sec\theta-\tan\theta\ge \sqrt{{3}}\]

  This is equivalent to:
  \[\sqrt{{3}}\cos\theta+\sin\theta=2\cos\left[\theta-\frac{{\pi}}{{6}}\right] \ge 2\]

  This holds for all valid $\theta$, with equality when $\theta = \frac{{\pi}}{{6}}$ and $x=y=\frac{{1}}{{\sqrt{{3}}}}$.

  **Proof of the right inequality:**

  From the conditions, $y \le 1$ and from the square root constraint, $y \ge \frac{{1}}{{4x}} \ge \frac{{1}}{{4}}$.

  This gives:
  \[(4y-1)(1-y) \ge 0 \iff 1+4y^2 \le 5y\]

  Also, from $(2y-1)^2 \ge 0$:
  \[4y^2+1 \ge 4y \ge 4xy \Rightarrow \sqrt{{4xy-1}} \le 2y\]

  Rearranging:
  \[\sqrt{{4xy-1}}\left(\frac{{\sqrt{{4xy-1}}}}{{2y}}-1\right)+\frac{{1+4y^2}}{{2y}} \le \frac{{5}}{{2}}\]

  Equality holds when $x=1, y=\frac{{1}}{{4}}$.



  Example 2

  Problem:
  Prove that $\sqrt{{2}}$ is irrational.

  Forum discussions:
  Post 1 by Alice: I'm stuck on this problem. Can anyone help?

  Post 2 by Bob: Sure! Here's the proof.

  Assume $\sqrt{{2}}$ is rational. Then $\sqrt{{2}} = \frac{{p}}{{q}}$ where $p$ and $q$ are coprime integers.

  Squaring both sides: $2 = \frac{{p^2}}{{q^2}}$, so $p^2 = 2q^2$.

  This means $p^2$ is even, so $p$ is even. Let $p = 2k$ for some integer $k$.

  Then $(2k)^2 = 2q^2$, which gives $4k^2 = 2q^2$, so $q^2 = 2k^2$.

  This means $q^2$ is even, so $q$ is even.

  But if both $p$ and $q$ are even, they share a common factor of 2, contradicting our assumption that they are coprime.

  Therefore, $\sqrt{{2}}$ is irrational.

  Post 3 by Alice: Thanks Bob! That's so clear now.

  Output:
  **Proof by contradiction:**

  Assume $\sqrt{{2}}$ is rational. Then $\sqrt{{2}} = \frac{{p}}{{q}}$ where $p$ and $q$ are coprime integers.

  Squaring both sides: $2 = \frac{{p^2}}{{q^2}}$, so $p^2 = 2q^2$.

  This means $p^2$ is even, therefore $p$ must be even. Let $p = 2k$ for some integer $k$.

  Substituting: $(2k)^2 = 2q^2$, which gives $4k^2 = 2q^2$, so $q^2 = 2k^2$.

  This means $q^2$ is even, therefore $q$ must be even.

  However, if both $p$ and $q$ are even, they share a common factor of 2, contradicting our assumption that they are coprime.

  Therefore, $\sqrt{{2}}$ must be irrational.
